            <h1>TGIF - Thank God I'm Fucked (Up)</h1>
            <h2>Games for Getting Everyone Involved</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Roll two dice to choose a number. You can play one of two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each person rolls the dice and hits the button based on their roll. In this system, prompts can be repeated and you can stay in one mode for as long as you would like.</li>
                <li>When someone rolls the dice, everyone in the circle completes the prompt as shown. In this system, if you re-roll a number, you roll again. Leave this category when all prompts have been completed.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>How you play is up to you! Once the prompt is done, pass the dice to the person on your left and roll again. You may get out of answering anything/completing a task by drinking 3 times. For these games, you can play them for the recommended time or as long as you desire.

                    <p>Start with the person who rolled the dice - they are in the "hot seat." For 90 seconds, the circle may ask them any questions you want (don't be afraid to target them - and be fast) and they can only pass on one question. In order to pass, take a drink. After that person is done, they choose the next person to be placed in the "hot seat" and this coninues until everyone has gone.</p>

                    <p>This game is similar to "Ya feel me" but more of a PG-13 version. The person who rolled the dice closes their eyes. The circle then silently votes on who kisses them on the cheek. Still with their eyes closed, they must guess who is the kisser. Continue until everyone has guessed once.</p>

Everyone in the circle can guess at any time, but you only get one guess per round. The first person to guess hands out a drink and becomes the next imitator.</p>

                    <h3>Rice Purity Quest</h3>
                    <p>This game can get you hammered (based on how dirty you are). Google the "rice purity test" and have one person read the prompts. If you have done the deed stated in the prompt, take a sip. Repeat this for all 100 questions and see how dirty your friends have been in the past.</p>

                    <p>The person who rolled the dice must exit the room (after the rules are read). Everyone in the circle needs some sort of cup. Pour any liquid in the cup (this game is typically played with shots but you can play with any drink - pace yourselves). REMEMBER WHICH CUP IS YOURS! Place the cups all over the table and invite the person who left the room back in. That person chooses a cup - the cup chosen is the person who takes the shot in their own cup (or drink) and kiss the person who chose the cup. In simple terms, person chooses cup, cup owner drinks and must kiss person who chose cup.</p>

                    <p>One person plays at a time, starting with the person who rolled the dice. You need a phone with a 10 second timer for this game. Your musical knowledge will definitely help. The rest of the circle will take turns saying random words, and the person playing has 10 seconds to sing song lyrics containing that word. Each person gets 5 words, and you take a drink when you can't think of a song. Rotate who plays and play until you get bored.</p>

                    <p>Sit or stand in a circle. Everyone needs a few pieces of paper and a pen. Starting with the person who rolled the dice, ask a question you think most people in the circle wouldn't know. Everyone writes down their answer and reveals them 1 by 1. Whoever gets the answer wrong takes a sip and the next person in the circle repeats. Play one round of the circle or until you get bored.</p>

                    <h3>Psyched as Sikowitz</h3>
                    <p>This drinking game brings back a scene from Victorious. Someone in the circle yells out a scene that you have to act out. Then, starting with the beginning of the alphabet, the person who rolled the dice gives a line in the scene. Going clockwise, the next person in the circle says a line that also fits the scene, but starting with the next letter. You continue going until someone doesn't start with the correct letter, then they are out, and have to take a drink. Do a new scene with the peolpe left. Try to say outrageous things and psych out your opponents. Play until there is 1 person left or you get bored.</p>

                    <p>Starting with the person who rolled, they have to come up with a random word. Then, starting with the person to their left, you make sentences saying "Sex with me is like (word chosen)... and then you finish with a funny statement. Everyone in the circle says theirs and then the group votes on whose is the funniest. That person hands out a drink, and the next person in the circle says a word. This game is played until people get bored.</p>
