        <p>This game is not meant for those who take offense or for the wholesome. You are here to learn everyone's deepest darkest secrets, and to become much closer (if you so choose). To play this game, you need the following tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 dice</li>
            <li>As many solo cups (or regular cups) as players</li>
            <li>Paper and pencils/pens</li>
            <li>Alcohol of some sort (trust me - you'll need it)</li>
            <li>You imagination and an open mind</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*Disclaimer: these prompts were mostly created before COVID hit, and some are admittedly not COVID safe, so play at your own risk.</p>
